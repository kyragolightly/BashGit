# D-Lab Introduction to Bash + Git

This is the repository for D-Lab's Introduction to Bash + Git workshop. Laptop, Internet connection, and Zoom account required.

# Workshop Goals

An introduction to programming basics in Bash and GitHub that are often assumed, but that you might have never had good instruction on!
The first half of this workshop will introduce you to navigating your computerâ€™s file system and basic Bash commands to remove the fear of working with the command line to give you the confidence to use it to increase your productivity.
The second half of this workshop will introduce you to Git, a powerful tool for keeping track of changes you make to the files in a project. You can use it to synchronize your work across computers, collaborate with others, and even deploy applications to the cloud. In this workshop, you will learn the basics to understand and use Git, including working with the popular "social coding" website, GitHub. 

# Installation Instructions

In preparation for the upcoming workshop you will need to make sure you have Bash installed and have created a GitHub user account. 

### 1) Install Bash

**OSX**

* Your system might have Git installed already. Test this by opening a terminal and typing 'git'.
* If not, install [xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the app store. When this process completes, open a terminal and type 'git' to see if the process worked correctly.

**Windows**

* Windows users must install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

**Linux**

* Use the package manager by typing: `$ apt-get install git`

### 2) Create a Github account

* All participants should create a free GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

### 3) Download the workshop materials

Download the workshop materials by visiting the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BashGit). To run these lessons on your laptop: 

* Click the green "Clone or Download" button
* Click "Download Zip"
* Extract this file someplace familiar (we recommend Desktop) 

> If you are a Git user, simply clone this repository by opening a terminal and typing: `git clone https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/BashGit.git`

We will take a few minutes at the start of the workshop to make sure everyone has Bash installed and the workshop materials downloaded. Please feel free to email [dlab-frontdesk@berkeley.edu](dlab-frontdesk@berkeley.edu) or visit our [help desk](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/frontdesk) if you have any questions.

# Is Bash not working on your laptop?

Attend the workshop anyway, we can provide you with a cloud-based solution (DataHub or Binder) until you figure out the problems with your local installation. 

If you have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can run these lessons on UC Berkeley's DataHub by clicking [this link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdlab-berkeley%2FBashGit&urlpath=tree%2FBashGit%2F&branch=master). By using this link, you can save your work and come back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go straight to [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and you click on the introduction-to-bash-+-git folder.
If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this [Binder button](https://hub.mybinder.turing.ac.uk/user/dlab-berkeley-bashgit-in1h0k5a/tree). By using this button, you cannot save your work.
